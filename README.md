# 🌍 Environmental Analytics: Climate Change Trends Dashboard

A powerful and interactive **Climate Change Trends Dashboard** designed to visualize and analyze global environmental data using tools like **Power BI** and **Python**.
This project aims to raise awareness and provide insights into patterns of **climate change**, including temperature rise, CO₂ emissions, deforestation, and other key environmental indicators.

## 📊 Project Overview

This dashboard allows users to:

* 🌡️ Visualize **temperature trends** across regions and decades
* 🌲 Track **deforestation rates** and forest cover changes
* 💨 Monitor **CO₂ and greenhouse gas emissions** over time
* 🌎 Compare **climate metrics** across countries and continents
* 📈 Explore interactive **charts, maps, and time-series** visuals

Built for researchers, educators, policy analysts, and environmentally conscious users looking to **understand climate patterns** through **data-driven insights**.
